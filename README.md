# Obseity-Classification
Created an innovative Obesity Checker utilizing a machine learning algorithm.  Designed the system to analyze user-provided health metrics, employing a custom-tailored  algorithm for accurate obesity classification. The algorithm, trained on a diverse dataset, exhibits  the ability to provide real-time predictions.


python code:

import streamlit as st
import joblib
from PIL import Image

model = joblib.load("LRoc.pkl")

bmi_labels = ["Normal Weight", "Obese", "Overweight", "Underweight"]

def predict_bmi_category(age, gender, height, weight):
    bmi = weight / (height / 100) ** 2
    bmi_label = model.predict([[age, gender, height, weight]])[0]
    bmi_category = bmi_labels[int(bmi_label)]
    return bmi_label, bmi_category, bmi
